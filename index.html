        MY DISLIKES >⌓<｡ : I hate doing things I'm forced to do, but I think
        this is quite obvious to anyone. If I'm being honest with you at first I
        really hated coding because my brother wouldn't leave me alone with
        coding , but I've grown to like it. I don't like being lonely but most
        of the time I want to be alone as most teenagers. I hate liars and empty
        words too. I think that would be it. <br />
