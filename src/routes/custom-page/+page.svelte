 These drawings are all from this summer/year. <br>Firstly the koi fish drawing the reference is from pinterest it took about 5-6 hours. 
I watched the apothecary diaries while drawing this I LOVED it anyways let's move on. <br>
Next up is the pink lilies, the coloring was SO MUCH time after i colored all
 of those things my hand was cramping╭(* _ *)╮. This took about 5-7 hours ( ´•̥̥̥ o•̥̥̥`).<br>
 Next up we have those roses, I struggled with making it look good BC there were too much details, 
 but thats my fault for choosing it but in the end I ended up really liking this drawing (─‿─). <br>
 We have the those three lilies now this wasn't that hard tbh , but it still wasn't that easy either
 but the end  result is always worth it. <br>
 We have the "one day I am gonna grow wings" mostly I only did it for the trend and bc I really liked 
 the song. This was pretty easy tbh it only took like 1-2 hours I think. <br> Then we have that Billie Eilish
 I stopped drawing it halfway bc I really hated how it looked. Everything looked really weird it just didn't look
like Billie. Here the bones on her shirt was really time consuming. <br> Now we have the pixel rose, now this one
I thought I wouldn't finish it at all, because when I drew every pixel, petal and THE LEAVES I hate drawing leaves
first the shading looked of then the THOSE STUPID LEAVES were of but in the end I really liked it, it took about 6 hours. <br>
Next up is the cat this should've taken way LESS time then it needed to I just overthinked it or idk but this little
thing took almost 1 and a half hour which is kinda crazy. <br> We have the last one the bow this was really easy it was
like 30-45 mins but only because I redid a part of it bc it looked weird but in the I ended up liking this too（＾ω＾）.
