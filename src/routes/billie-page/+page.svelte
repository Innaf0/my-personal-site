    <h1 class="site-title"> Billie Eilish fanpage</h1>
    <div class="billie">
I started listening to Billie in 2019 even though I was only seven. People sometimes hated me for it or loved me, in 2021 
I mostly got hate because they taught she was a satanist. Even after that I still listened to her when I got hste, but 
I didn't purposely say it out loud that I really liked her music. <br> It was kinda weird seeing everyone fanning over her in 2024
because of her new album I'm not saying that I wasn't happy for her or anything but yk. <br> I really wanted to go to her concert 
whilw she was in europe but there was never a good time, I still really want to go maybe someday I will get a chance to go. <br>
My fav albums from her are hte(Happier than ever), wwafawdwg(when we all fall asleep where do we go), dsam (dont smile at me), hmhas
(hit me hard and soft) tbh I like almost every album she has ever released lol. <br> Here are some of my fav songs from her:ilomilo, xanny, 
goodbye, happier than ever,  Billie Bossa nova, There for I am, No time to die, GOLDWING, Getting Older, wish u were gay, my strange addiction,
listen before I go, I love u, party favor, watch, THE GREATEST, BITTERSUITE, la'mour de ma vie, overheated, oxytocin, male fantasy, skinny, 
idontwannabeyouanymore, blue and your power I KNOW IT'S A LOT but I really do love all these songs, even now while writing this. <br>
Her songs motivate me and they even help me when I feel like nothing can, I feel a deep connection with some of her songs. And I'm
really thankful to her in way. Even though she'll probably never know this I'm still very grateful for her.
(it's almost 3 am for me so please don't mind my writing mistakes (｡･･｡) )
